# Hathora-Unity Guide

This guide helps you setup:
1. Low-level Hathora SDK and high-level SDK wrapper.
3. Implementation demo, including:
   * Unity's 3rd-person 3D template 
   * [Hathora's Unity Plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/256651) for implementation example
   * [FishNet](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet) for arbitrary Unity net code example
     * [Tugboat](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/components/transports/tugboat) for arbitrary FishNet Transport example
     * Optionally, replace the net code with others like Mirror or Unity NGO

# 1. Server Config

1. Find the top menu **Hathora/Configuration (Server)** window -> Create new.

2. Selecting your *HathoraServerConfig*, click *Register* -> opens a browser tab.

3. After logging in; jump back to Unity *HathoraServerConfig* -> click **Create new application**.

# 2. Server Deployment (+Room)

1. Complete `1. Server Config` above, still inspecting the *HathoraServerConfig*.

2. Click the bottom **Build, Upload & Deploy New Version** button.

3. On success, go to the *Create Room* section -> Choose a Region -> click **Create Room**.

4. Click the "Copy Connection Info" for  host (IP) and port info; use this to connect as a client to a net code server!

# 3. Client Demos

**Included are two demos:**
1. Hello World
2. Hathora SDK

## Client Demo #1:  *Hello World*

### About

This demo skips the Hathora SDK and simply uses Hathora as a Unity net code dedicated game server host: Upload any Unity net code solution to Hathora Cloud.

### Quickstart

1. Finish the "Quickstart (Server)" above to deploy a server -> create a room -> copy the `host:ip` connection info.

2.  Finding the scene component *Tugboat* at HathoraSceneDemo.**NetworkManager**:

    1. Paste the connection info *host* info to Togboat's **Client Address**.
    2. Paste the connection info *port* info to Tugboat's **Port**.

3. Run the `HathoraDemoScene` -> click **Hello World** -> Click **Client** to connect to the Room:

5. You are now connected to the server -> If other clients were connected, you would see them, too. Press **[R]** to send a ping/pong RPC to/from the server:

## Client Demo #2: *Hathora SDK*

### About 
This demo is more-programmatic, using an example implementation wrapper of the Hathora SDK to, as a Client:

1. Login
2. Create/join a Room (called *Lobby* as a client). 
3. Dynamically get the connection info from Hathora Cloud (opposed to setting it manually).

### Quickstart

1. Finish the "Quickstart (Server)" and stop after Step #4 -> Click the **Copy AppId** button at the top.

2. Paste the AppId to Assets/Hathora/**HathoraClientConfig**:

4. Run the `HathoraDemoScene` -> click **Hathora SDK** -> Click **Client Auth** to start:

5. Click **Create Lobby** to create a room (or "Get" if you have a RoomId).
    ðŸ’¡ Lobby is the client-side method for telling the server to create a *Room*.
    
6. You now have a **RoomId** -> From here, list public lobbies or get the server info to connect:

7. You may now either list public lobbies or get the connection info to connect to the lobby, such as host (ip) and port:

# Troubleshooting

> What do I need to do with the deployment container's port?

* Nothing! This is arbitrary: Set and forget. You'll be using the _room's_ ip:port; not the container's port.

> I tried copy+pasting a host name (not a pure IP address) into the NetworkManager's `Address` property, but I'm instantly getting a timeout.

* Within the Hathora web console details page, ensure the logs parity with what you normally see in Unity to ensure !errors.

* In the NetworkManager's `Tugboat` component (from `NetworkManager` GameObject), ensure the `Client Address` and `Server Port` match your room's server:port.

* Unity NGO requires raw IP addresses (opposed to host names, like `proxy.hathora.dev` or `localhost`). If you only have a host name, try converting to an IP address via a tool like https://whatismyipaddress.com/hostname-ip . If you use NGO, you probably want to programatically do this, eventually.

> When I tried implementing this tutorial logic into my own game, both Player GameObjects move at the same time from 1 PC - how come?

* For your player controller's `Update()`, you may want to add `if (!IsOwner) return` so only the owned network object can be controlled.

> When using _both_ the "Server" + "Client" buttons (Player1 'Host Mode'), both players spawn; Player1 can move their `NetworkPlayer` and see the movement on Player2 when they pressed the `Client` button (Player2). Why can I only move Player1 and not Player2?

* Player2 needs _permission_ from the Server to move: If following another guide, you may be using the `Network Transform` script. While this is server-authoritative and more-secure, the demo makes use of `Client Network Transform` to give power to the Client for demo purposes and to keep code minimal.

> Why does the other player look like his model isn't using animations; just "gliding" while moving?

* Be sure to add a `Network Transform` component to your Player! To save bandwidth, uncheck the `syncing` options you don't need (such as Scale).

> With Unity NGO: When I override OnNetworkSpawn() and check ownership of the Player (as a client), I'm the owner. The next time I call test ping, I'm not! What's going on?

* This seems to be a Unity NGO bug: The server appears to take ownership a few moments *after* the client spawns. You can async/await for !IsOwner. This is likely because clients can join *before* a server kicks in.

> I tried swapping FishNet for Unity NGO, but experiencing oddities.

* Remember that Unity NGO is in very early access: We recommend you use a production-ready service, for now.

# TODO

1. Add a license to this repo.
2. Implement the "Join Lobby" button in the *Hathora SDK* demo.
